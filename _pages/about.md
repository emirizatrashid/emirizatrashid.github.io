Selamat datang! My name is Emir and I am currently a senior research associate at the Centre for Technology, Strategy, and Sustainability at the Asia School of Business. I earned an MSc. in Political Science and Political Economy at the London School of Economics and Political Science and a B.S. in Applied Mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles.
					
My research interest is in political economy, specifically in the effects of political accountability on government expenditures. Typically, I incorporate causal inference methods and formal models in my research design.

My current project at the CTSS is in the political economy of energy transition, as it represents a major obstacle in obtaining a low-carbon future. My master's dissertation at the LSE is analyzing the effects of anti-hopping laws on cross-ministry cooperation. I also organize the workshop for researchers at the Asia School of Business -- anyone interested in presenting and/or attending the workshop, contact me via email. 

Announcements!
